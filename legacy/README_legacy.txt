LEGACY FILES - GOOD CHOICE CHORD

This folder contains legacy material related to the original idea and early development of this project.

📌 Context:
The initial concept and implementation were created by Jeanco Volfe between 2022 and 2023, during a period of personal study in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

At the time, the project was born from the desire to simplify chord suggestions based on widely known harmonic principles. However, limitations in programming experience — especially regarding enharmonic logic — made the development extremely challenging. As a result, the project remained incomplete and was set aside for a while.

With the advancement of AI technologies and a deeper understanding of modularization, documentation, and version control, the project was revived and improved in 2025. The original script laid the foundation for the current working version and represents a significant stage of learning.

🗂️ Files:
- `2023-script-original.js` → The first implementation attempt (partially functional)
- `screenshot-original-structure.png` → A screenshot showing the folder structure and timestamps from the original development environment

📝 Note:
This folder is not part of the active application logic. It exists purely for historical and authorship purposes, to document the evolution of the idea and codebase over time.
